    <h1>Hello, I'm Alhagie Nyang</h1>
    <p>
      I'm an aspiring <span class="highlight">Backend Developer</span> with a passion for solving problems through technology. I love building systems that are efficient, scalable, and well-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently studying at the <span class="highlight">University of The Gambia</span>, where Iâ€™m deepening my understanding of computer science and software development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside my university education, Iâ€™m enrolled in the <span class="highlight">ALX Backend Development Program</span>â€”a challenging and transformative course that is helping me grow into a world-class backend engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey in tech is driven by curiosity and a desire to make a real impact. Every day, I strive to learn something new, write better code, and bring value to whatever project Iâ€™m working on.
